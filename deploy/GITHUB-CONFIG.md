# GitHub Actions deployment configuration

## Frontend repository

Repository variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_KAKAO_REST_API_KEY`

Repository secrets:

- `CI_GITHUB_TOKEN`: fine-grained PAT targeting `rktclgh/ieum_BE` with
  repository Contents write permission, used only for `repository_dispatch`.

The `frontend-updated` dispatch must include the commit that produced the
frontend export in `client_payload.frontend_sha`. The value must be the full
40-character lowercase Git commit SHA. The backend workflow checks out exactly
that SHA and verifies it again after checkout. Backend push and manual runs use
the frontend `main` branch as their fallback source.

The app-main deployment performs one final comparison with the current
frontend `main` SHA immediately before SSH deployment. A newer frontend commit
therefore makes an older run fail closed instead of publishing stale assets.
Production deployment concurrency uses `cancel-in-progress: false`, so an
in-flight migration or deployment is never interrupted by a newer run.

## Backend repository

Repository secrets:

- `CI_GITHUB_TOKEN`: token that can read `rktclgh/ieum_FE` when the
  frontend repository is private.
- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`: Docker Hub account or organization name.
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`: Docker Hub access token with read/write permission.

Create private Docker Hub repositories named `ieum-app-main` and `ieum-app-ai`.

Create both GitHub Environments before enabling the workflows.

### `app-main-production`

Variables:

- `SSH_HOST=54.116.123.11`
- `SSH_USER=ubuntu`
- `SSH_PORT=22`
- `DEPLOY_PATH=/home/ubuntu/ieum/app-main`
- `APP_MAIN_PRIVATE_BIND_ADDRESS=172.31.38.97`
- `LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL`: optional when the origin certificate already exists;
  required only for initial Let's Encrypt issuance
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_KAKAO_REST_API_KEY`

Secrets:

- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: complete PEM contents
- `SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS`: verified known_hosts line for `54.116.123.11`
- `APP_MAIN_ENV_FILE`: completed `deploy/env/app-main.env.example`; its
  `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL` must use the production database host, never
  `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or the example placeholder, and it must include
  `INQUIRY_ADMIN_EMAIL`

### `app-ai-production`

Variables:

- `SSH_HOST=54.116.69.21`
- `SSH_USER=ubuntu`
- `SSH_PORT=22`
- `DEPLOY_PATH=/home/ubuntu/ieum/app-ai`
- `APP_AI_BIND_ADDRESS=172.31.33.42`

Secrets:

- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: complete PEM contents
- `SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS`: verified known_hosts line for `54.116.69.21`
- `APP_AI_ENV_FILE`: completed `deploy/env/app-ai.env.example`

### Remote database migration gate

The production database is a private RDS instance whose port 5432 accepts
traffic only from the production EC2 security groups. GitHub-hosted runners
must not receive database credentials and cannot connect to that private RDS
endpoint. Each binary workflow therefore copies only the migration helper,
`v25_user_auth_version.sql`, and `v26_admin_audit_logs.sql` to its production
EC2 host and runs the helper there before either application binary is built.

Before enabling either workflow, install the PostgreSQL client on both EC2
hosts. On each host, copy
`deploy/env/admin-dashboard-migration.env.example` to
`$DEPLOY_PATH/.migration.env`, fill in `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `PGDATABASE`, and
`PGUSER`, then configure either `PGPASSWORD` or an absolute `PGPASSFILE` path.
The file is sourced as a shell environment file, so quote values containing
shell-special characters. Make it owned by the SSH deployment user and run
`chmod 600 "$DEPLOY_PATH/.migration.env"`. If `PGPASSFILE` is used, that file
must also be a regular, non-symlink file with mode 600.

The workflow checks `.migration.env`, its permissions, the selected password
source, and the remote `psql` command before running the helper. The password
stays on EC2: it is never interpolated as a GitHub secret and never appears in
an SSH argument or workflow log. Missing configuration, unsafe permissions,
an unavailable `psql`, a schema mismatch, or a migration error stops the
workflow before Gradle, image build, or SSH application deployment.

Generate candidate host-key lines with `ssh-keyscan -H <host>`, but verify the
fingerprint through AWS or another trusted channel before saving the result as
`SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS`. The workflow never disables host-key verification.

The app-main workflow installs an Nginx reverse proxy for
`https://ieum.rktclgh.site` and keeps app-main reachable only through loopback
and its private address. Allow inbound ports 80 and 443 publicly. Allow port
8080 only from the app-ai security group or `172.31.33.42`; do not expose it to
the internet. On app-ai, allow port 8081 only from the app-main security group
or `172.31.38.97`. Restrict SSH port 22 to an administrator CIDR after initial
setup.

Before the first deployment, prepare the RDS schema/extensions, S3 and Bedrock
permissions, app-ai private-port security-group rule, and TLS. Deploy app-ai
first, then deploy app-main after the frontend static export and Spring static
serving changes are ready.
